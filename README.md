# ZMK Config for my Keyboards

Unibody split keyboards with simple layer-based keymaps. No mod-tab or other behaviors. The most advanced features are combos and tri-layers (both of which I hardly use). 

## Core aspects

* Config as a module for "proper" zmk integration, and to support container-based builds (including github actions)
* ZMK Studio support
* Support for german keyboard layout and characters
* Support for MacOS symbols

## Todos

* build all keyboards/shields in one go
* build all keyboards/shields with the same keymap file
